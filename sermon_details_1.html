                                Then Jesus was led by the [Holy] Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. 2 After He had gone without food for forty days and forty nights, He became hungry. 3 And the tempter came and said to Him, “If You are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread.” 4 But Jesus replied, “It is written and forever remains written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes out of the mouth of God.’”5 Then the devil took Him into the holy city [Jerusalem] and placed Him on the pinnacle (highest point) of the temple. 6 And he sai [mockingly] to Him, “If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down; for it is written, ‘He will command His angels concerning You [to serve, care for, protect and watch over You]’; and‘ They will lift you up on their hands So that You will not strike Your foot against a stone.’”7 Jesus said to him, “On the other hand, it is written and forever remains written, ‘You shall not test the Lord your God.’” 8 Again, the devil took Him up on a very high mountain and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory [splendor, magnificence, and excellence] of them; 9 and he said to Him, “All these things I will give You if You fall down and worship me.” 10 Then Jesus said to him, “Go away, Satan! For it is written and forever remains written, ‘YOU shall worship the Lord your God, and serve Him only.’” 11 Then the devil left Him, and angels came and ministered to Him [bringing Him food and serving Him].

                <p class="text-left" style="padding-top: 4rem;">The scripture above gives an account of Jesus’ experience with the devil in the wilderness.  The devil tempted him after He had fasted for forty days and forty nights. Jesus’ experience reveals the enemy of faith.  The enemy of your faith-life is none other than temptation. All believers must guard against this enemy called ‘TEMPTATION’. This is because the temptation is the beginning point of one’s backsliding if not destruction. Our progress in our spiritual walk with the lord is largely dependent on how we deal with the enemy of temptation. If we do not deal with this enemy, we are prone to becoming victims of backsliding or falling from faith. Jesus Christ found himself in this place of temptation but he was conscious of himself and aware of the enemy. The enemy is very daring indeed. If he can tempt the son of God, the deity, how much more can he tempt you and me? We have to be conscious of this possibility and guard our position in God. Jesus knew how to confront the enemy of faith. He used the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God; “It is written and forever remains written…” Mathew 4:1-11 depicts the confrontation of Jesus Christ with the devil. It is not about a physical fight but a Spiritual one. 2 Corinthians 10:3-5 states that:</p>

                <h3>WHAT IS TEMPTATION?</h3>
                <p>The Greek word for temptation is ‘peirasmos’.  This has two meanings:</p>
                <ol style="padding-left: 1rem;">
                    <li>An urge or desire that induces one to commit an act that has regrettable consequences.</li>
                    <li>Fleshly enticement that defies God’s will for one’s spiritual life.</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="text-left" style="padding-top: 1rem;">Temptation is portrayed in the context of Adam and Eve in the Old Testament. Genesis chapter 3 is a reflection of how the devil entices Eve to eat the fruit from the forbidden middle tree. Adam and Eve develop an urge to eat the fruit one after the other despite the clear divine commandments given to them by God.  They allow themselves to engage in a discourse with the devil (very dangerous for anyone who does this) which makes them susceptible to temptation. The conversation with the devil opens a window of enticement and inducement as it did for Adam and Eve.  They go ahead and eat from the fruit from the tree of knowledge of good and evil and the devil wins.

                    Genesis 2: 15-17:</p>

            <div class="container sermon_para">
                <p class="text-left" style="padding-top: 4rem;">Adam and Eve do not pay attention to the stern commandment as they choose to listen to the devil. This precipitates serious and regrettable consequences of being banished from the Garden of Eden and attracting a curse from God. They fell short of God’s expectations. Through this one man, sin which led to death came into the world. But thanks be to God for Jesus Christ who came and paid the price for our redemption. In the middle of temptation, always remember there are always options. In this case, we must always remember whom we serve; God. And God always provides a way out.

                    See 1st Corinthians 10:13:</p>

                <p class="text-left" style="padding-top: 4rem;">Yielding to temptation is not our posture. As children of God, we have the power to overcome. Adam and Eve disappoint God when they heed the voice of the enemy instead of God’s voice. In Genesis chapter 3 the devil casts doubt in their mind with this statement: “Can it really be that God has said, ‘You shall not eat from [b]any tree of the garden’?” Being in doubt is a dangerous position to be in. That is the verge of temptation. We cannot afford to doubt God and trust the devil. Yet this is what we do when we doubt. Doubt results in disobedience to the commandments of God as in the case of Adam and Eve. </p>

            <div class="container sermon_para">
                <p class="text-left" style="padding-top: 1rem;">Temptation also refers to trials that are divinely permitted, like in the case of Jesus Christ in the wilderness. Jesus was led by the Spirit of God into the wilderness to be tempted by the Devil.  It was God’s plan to permit trials in the life of Jesus so that something greater could be produced out of it. Therefore, by God’s grace and the leadership of the Holy Spirit, Jesus was led to the wilderness to be tempted by the devil as recorded in Mathew 4:1-11. The same is replicated in Luke 22:28-30 where Jesus makes a profound statement in addressing his disciples as follows:</p>

                <p class="text-left" style="padding-top: 4rem;">The two scriptures reveal that there are two dimensions of temptations:</p>
                <p>The Greek word for temptation is ‘peirasmos’.  This has two meanings:</p>
                <ol style="padding-left: 1rem;">
                    <li>That which is induced or brought about by the devil to make a believer fall from his faith life in God.</li>
                    <li>That which God allows a believer to go through for a purpose.</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="text-left" style="padding-top: 1rem;">The devil is the designer of temptations and trials. But any time God wants to birth something out of a believer, He allows them to go through a certain situation or a testing moment to produce something greater or to make them better vessels of God. In this case, count it joy.  Because sometimes God allows troubles and distresses as shown in Psalms 71: 20-21:</p>

Even though sometimes we drink the cup of suffering, just as Jesus did on the cross (Mt. 20:22), we overcome. It may sound unrealistic, but God allows trouble to come your way for a good reason. In John 15:2 God uses trials and temptations to prune us so that we may be productive in the kingdom of God.</p>

                <p class="text-left" style="padding-top: 1rem;">However, beware of the enemy’s schemes to entice or allure you and make you fall from your faith life. The two dimensions of peirasmos call for the Spirit of discernment in distinguishing the source of the temptation. Otherwise, as the child of God, you can end up in a backslidden state. Always pray to enquire of God, where temptations and trials are leading to. Jesus provides a perfect example of how to overcome trials and temptations. He is the second Adam while the one in the Garden of Eden is the first Adam. The first Adam (Adam & Eve) failed to resist the devil and yielded to the enticement and inducement. By doing this, the first Adam went against the will of God. The distinction between the first Adam and the second Adam is that the second Adam (Jesus Christ) resisted the devil and overcame temptation and trials.</p>
                <h3 class="text-left" style="padding-top: 1rem;">What kind of temptation did Jesus face and how did He deal with it?</h3>
                <p class="text-left" style="padding-top: 1rem;">The temptation concerned the element of food, power, and control or authority. These were designed to make Jesus yield to bodily appetites, earthly power, and position so as to feel in control of the kingdoms of this world. Note that when the enemy wants to get you out of your steadfastness he will target the following:</p>
                <p class="text-left" style="padding-top: 1rem;">1.<strong>Lust of the eyes</strong>- Whereas Eve saw the fruit was good and yielded; Jesus confronted the craving and resisted turning the stone into bread. The lust of the eyes is fleshly and this is where the enemy traps most believers. Believers fall because of the enticement of what they see. If one does not always pray for the will of God to be done, the fall is always great. Seeing in the Spirit will help a believer to discern the will of God.  According to Galatians 5:16, we cannot carry out the desires of the flesh if we depend on the Spirit of God:</p>

We do not also put God to the test by jumping off high towers to prove to the devil that the angels will shield us from falling with a bang. Power and authority are executed for the right purposes. It is not meant to be paraded for our selfish ends but for God’s glory.

In this way, God will always rescue us from temptations and we will be able to endure and overcome it with joy without yielding to it (1 Corinthians 10:13). This brings us to: </p>
                <h3 class="text-left" style="padding-top: 1rem;">How to deal with temptations </h3>
                <p class="text-left" style="padding-top: 1rem;">1. Avoid the pathway to temptation. Psalms 101:3: I will set no worthless or wicked thing before my eyes. I hate the practice of those who fall away [from the right path]; It will not grasp hold of me. </p>
                <p class="text-left" style="padding-top: 1rem;">2. Beware of those who can entice you. Choose friends wisely. Be careful with whom you hung out. This is in accordance with 1 Corinthians 15:33: Do not be deceived: [a] “Bad company corrupts good morals.” </p>
                <p class="text-left" style="padding-top: 1rem;">It does not matter how good you are. You always get influenced by what you concentrate on. And friends are a great influence positively or negatively. The negative aspect is illustrated in Proverbs 1:18-19 as follows: </p>

Therefore, we must be armed appropriately for war (warring in the mighty Name of Jesus). We must purpose to live a holy life by reading the word of God and praying at all times. We must not give an opportunity to the Devil. </p>
                <p class="text-left" style="padding-top: 1rem;">7. Walk in the fear of God. Put on the mind of Christ Jesus who stood and resisted the devil and did not yield into temptation.</p>
                <p class="text-left" style="padding-top: 1rem;">Indeed we are more than conquerors in Christ Jesus. We have nothing to fear because God has already predetermined our victory in every circumstance. Romans chapter 8:34-39 provides a perfect conclusion for this message.</p>
                
                <p class="text-left" style="padding-top: 1rem;">34 Who is the one who condemns us? Christ Jesus is the One who died [to pay our penalty], and more than that, who was raised [from the dead], and who is at the right hand of God interceding [with the Father] for us. 35 Who shall ever separate us from the love of [d] Christ? Will tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword? 36 Just as it is written and forever remains written, “For Your sake we are put to death all day long;
                We are regarded as sheep for the slaughter.” 37 Yet in all these things we are more than conquerors and gain an overwhelming victory through Him who loved us [so much that He died for us]. 38 For I am convinced [and continue to be convinced—beyond any doubt] that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present and threatening, nor things to come, nor powers, 39 nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us from the [unlimited] love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
