                <p style="padding-top: 4rem;"><span style="font-size: 200%;">T</span>he suffering of Jesus Christ on the cross, His death, and resurrection was not capital punishment. The devil, working through those who persecuted Him, might have thought so but God intended it for our redemption. It was the will of God for Jesus Christ to suffer, to die, and resurrect. The process Jesus Christ went through at crucifixion made our redemption possible. Without Jesus Christ’s suffering, there would be no salvation or Christianity. Sin had plunged us into slavery or the kingdom of darkness but Jesus Christ lay down His life for our deliverance from sin and death. Jesus Christ paid the price for our redemption.</p>
                <p style="padding-top: 1rem;">‘Redemption’ means bought back. The Greek word for ‘redemption’ is Apolutrosis which means, to be delivered from the slave market of sin. It is an act of buying back and regaining the original status or position. It is the process of getting us back to the original place where God had intended us to be initially. ‘Redemption’ has similar usage with the word ‘Ransom’ which means paying a price for the redemption of an item or to regain the original status. We had fallen short of God’s glory but He redeemed us. The following verses illustrate the process of redemption:</p>

                                Romans 4:25 underscores the purpose of Jesus Christ’s death and resurrection.  He died because of “our offenses” and was raised from the dead so that we would be justified.  For this reason, if you have not appropriated the work of redemption at the cross, get saved. His redemptive work was meant for you and I. Jesus Christ took upon himself all that was leveled against us. 2 Corinthians 5:18-19 further explains the redemptive work of the cross:

                <p class="text-left" style="padding-top: 4rem;">The scripture above highlights reconciliation to God as the key reason why Jesus Christ died on the cross for us. Accepting Jesus Christ as our savior gives us the opportunity to reinstate our relationship with God. Our trespasses are not imputed on us. Jesus bore the blame for us. (How loving and kind of our Lord and savior!) In the book of Genesis chapter 3, Adam and Eve ate from the forbidden tree and found themselves naked. The Doxa (Hebrew) – the glory of God had left them. See the verses below:</p>

She also gave to her husband with her, and he ate. 7 Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked, and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves [b]coverings. 8 And they heard the [c]sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the [d]cool of the day, and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden. 9 Then the Lord God called to Adam and said to him, “Where are you?” 10 So he said, “I heard Your voice in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked, and I hid myself.” 11 And He said, “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree of which I commanded you that you should not eat?” (Genesis 3:5-11)

                <p class="text-left" style="padding-top: 4rem;">Because Adam and Eve allowed the devil to tempt them into challenging the commandment of God, they become naked. They were devoid of God’s covering hence they were compelled to hide from His presence. This reflects our lives if we disobey and violate God’s instructions. God’s voice is continually calling to us “Where are you?” We need to appropriate the work of redemption at the cross. This calls us to evaluate our lifestyle and return to God to enjoy His fellowship “in the cool of the day”. It is our sins that have separated us from God. Isaiah 59 explains this position of separation as follows:</p>

                <p class="text-left" style="padding-top: 4rem;">Everlasting love is the status from which we were cut off due to our sinful nature. Our sinful nature denied us the status of being the children of light and instead became the children of darkness. We were cut off from God’s covenantal promises but Jesus Christ bought us back with his precious blood. The redemptive power of the blood of Jesus Christ works for those who believe in Him and they “will not perish but have everlasting life”.</p>

                    <li>It is through the suffering, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ that we attained Divine protection. Exodus 13:21 The Israelites are God’s people of the covenant. Although they were in bondage in the land of Egypt, God had purposed to deliver them from the hands of Pharaoh. Before the exodus, they had been instructed to kill a lamb and apply its blood on the doorposts of their houses. The angel of death passed over the houses marked with blood and they were saved from the hand of death. This is what was referred to as the Passover. After the Passover, they left Egypt and God assured them of his presence in their journey to Canaan. The presence of the Lord accompanied them in the form of a pillar of fire by night and a pillar of cloud during the day. This is illustrated in Exodus 13:21 as follows: </li>

The reason why the weapons of the enemy cannot materialize in the lives of the children of God is because Jesus Christ paid the price for their protection. Even though, as children of God, we are exposed to danger, fiery darts of the enemy, attacks, persecution and all forms of snares, the enemy cannot overcome us because he sees the blood of Jesus.

As children of God, we must be ready to “overcome him by the blood of the lamb and the word of [our] testimony”. The plans of the enemy will not prosper in our lives despite their manifestations. The enemy sees the blood of Jesus just as it was in the case of the Israelites and the blood of the lamb on their door posts. The Name of Jesus and what He represents as our redeemer, our divine protection, must be feared. Isaiah 59:19 states that:</p>

He received 39 painful lashes on His body for our healing. Healing is God’s children’s bread. Every infection has to bow in the Name of Jesus. In the book of John 1:29:</p>

                <p class="text-left" style="padding-top: 4rem;">The above verse is a picture of what Jesus did on the cross for us because without the shedding of blood there is no [c]remission. Verse 28 (a) of Hebrews chapter 9 shows how Jesus’ sacrifice was superior to the old order.  “So Christ was offered once to bear the sins of many.” The action does not need to be repeated. He sacrificed once. The blood of Jesus speaks of our salvation, protection, provision, preservation, and total healing. It shall be well with us. It shall be well with our families. Always declare the word of God in your life. Stand on the word of God in times of adversity because you have redemptive privileges. You were bought by the blood of Jesus Christ. Stand on Calvary ground and declare that by the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ I am more than a conqueror. Appropriate the redemptive work of the cross. Receive Jesus Christ as your Lord and Saviour by surrendering your life to Him (Song: All to Jesus I surrender, ALL to Him I freely give.)  Below is the first stanza: </p>
                <p class="text-left" style="padding-top: 1rem; font-style: italic;">  All to Jesus, I surrender <br>
                    All to Thee I freely give <br>
                    I will ever love and trust You <br>
                    In Your presence daily live </p>
                <p class="text-left" style="padding-top: 1rem;"> <strong>We are highly privileged by the suffering, the death, and the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Let us ALL surrender to Him our lives and appropriate the redemptive work at the cross.</strong> </p>
